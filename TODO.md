- Add TODOs from notes on workstation

- As of now each grid function is multiplied by the splitting function centered around the centered black holes. But Eric's recipie uses A_1 = f*A and A_2 = (1-f)*A. Add this to code.
  - Ask if the above is the best way. Both methods should be the same at least for equal-mass BHs
  - Implement "The idea is then to interpolate A1 only on grid 1 and A2 only on grid 2" from Erics email
